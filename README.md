# PySpark FPGrowth Analysis for Retail Transaction Data

## Introduction

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates how to use PySpark's FPGrowth algorithm to analyze retail transaction data. The code focuses on the Online Retail dataset, showcasing how to load, transform, and mine the data to uncover frequent itemsets and association rules. 

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have PySpark installed and configured. You can run the code in a Jupyter notebook or your preferred PySpark environment.

## Code Overview

- `PySpark FP-Growth Analysis.ipynb`: This script contains the PySpark code for loading, transforming, and analyzing the Online Retail dataset.
- `test.txt`: Sample dataset used in Part 0 for PySpark DataFrame operations.
- `Online Retail.xlsx`: Sample Online Retail dataset for frequent pattern mining in Part 1.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies, including PySpark.
3. Run the `PySpark FP-Growth Analysis.ipynb` script to analyze the retail transaction data.

## Data Sources
